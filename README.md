# Cocktail DB Web App

<p>
A small web application cataloging many different cocktails.
<br>
Just search for an alcoholic base, and get a list of every cocktail that contains that ingredient.

## A Brief History
<p>
I decided to create this small application to better understand API fetch requests using NEXT.js. Normally, I would have just made this project using standard HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, but I decided to use NEXT.js since I've been learning and using this framework recently.
</p>

## Technology Used
<h3>Frontend</h3>
<p>
  HTML, CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
</p>

<h3>Backend</h3>
<p>
  Cocktail DB API, React.js
</p>

<h3>Framework</h3>
<p>
  NEXT.js
</p>

## Optimizations
<p>
  
1. Accessibility:
- Instead of showcasing every cocktail in a grid, give users the option to view in list mode.

2. UI/UX Design:
- Provide users with the option to view the web application in Light mode or Dark mode. Currently, the design is leaning more towards Dark mode.
</p>

## Future Implementations
<p>
  
  - Add more search/filter options.
  
  - Use a different database that is maintained more frequently.
